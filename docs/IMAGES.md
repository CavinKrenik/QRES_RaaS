## Consensus Evolution

![Consensus Evolution](images/consensus_evolution.gif)

Time-series visualization of decentralized consensus convergence showing 100 nodes reaching agreement on shared model state through gossip protocol with Byzantine tolerance.

## Neural Swarm Visualization

![Neural Swarm Visualization](images/SwarmVisual.gif)

3D Bevy simulator visualization showing emergent swarm behavior with regime transitions (Calm/PreStorm/Storm) and reputation-weighted topology evolution.

## Neural Swarm Emergence

![Neural Swarm Emergence](images/neural_swarm_emergence.gif)

Visualizing a decentralized neural swarm recovering from a 15% packet loss interference zone. A single mutation propagates its evolved bytecode to heal the network through hardware-constrained gossip. This behavior emerges from network physics constraints, not central orchestration.

## Singularity Zero-Shot Convergence

![Swarm Singularity](images/singularity_zero_shot.png)

Convergence benchmarks showing 100 nodes reaching consensus on a shared predictive model in under 30 epochs, using only 8 KB of bandwidth per day per node. Traditional federated learning requires 8-10x the data and 100x the time.

## QRES Calm State Preview

![QRES Calm Preview](images/qres_calm_preview.png)

Nodes in the Calm regime (blue state) with normal entropy levels and stable predictions. This is the baseline operating mode before interference.

---

## QRES Storm State Preview

![QRES Storm Preview](images/qres_storm_preview.png)

Nodes in the Storm regime (red state) experiencing high entropy and surprise when exposed to the noise zone. This triggers adaptive learning and gene mutation.

---

## Accuracy Plot Analysis

![Accuracy Plot](images/accuracy_plot.png)

Performance metrics showing prediction accuracy across different operating regimes and network conditions.

---

## Adaptive Lossy Analysis

![Adaptive Lossy Analysis](images/adaptive_lossy_analysis.png)

Analysis of lossy compression effectiveness under adaptive conditions, demonstrating how the system maintains accuracy while reducing bandwidth.
